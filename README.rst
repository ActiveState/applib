applib
======

applib is a set of cross-platform application utilities that originated in
the PyPM_ project at ActiveState. It contains the following modules:

  - ``sh``: shell related operations including compression routines
  - ``textui``: utilities for textual UI such as progress bar and column
    printing
  - ``log``: log file rolling, exception-and-verbosity, sub commands, etc.

If you're interested in this module, please let me know - as that may motivate
me to document it fully.
